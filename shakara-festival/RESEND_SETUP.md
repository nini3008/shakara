# üöÄ Resend Newsletter Setup Guide

## Overview

We've switched to using Resend's built-in contact management and unsubscribe functionality. This is much better because:

- ‚úÖ **No database sync issues** - Resend manages everything
- ‚úÖ **Professional unsubscribe** - Automatic one-click unsubscribe
- ‚úÖ **Compliance ready** - Meets Gmail/Yahoo 2024 requirements
- ‚úÖ **Works everywhere** - Same experience in dev and production

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Resend Audience

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/audiences)
2. Click "Create Audience"
3. Name it: "Shakara Festival Newsletter"
4. Copy the Audience ID (looks like: `aud_xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Resend Audience ID for managing subscribers
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=aud_your_audience_id_here
```

### 3. How It Works Now

**Subscription Process:**
1. User submits newsletter form
2. Email added to local database (for our records)
3. **NEW**: Email also added to Resend Audience
4. Welcome email sent with Resend's automatic unsubscribe

**Unsubscribe Process:**
1. User clicks unsubscribe in email
2. **Resend handles everything automatically**
3. User is removed from audience
4. Future emails won't be sent to them

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Required for contact management
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=aud_your_audience_id

# Optional (removed - no longer needed)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://shakarafestival.com
```
